It is part of the AOZ2153 series and is marked with the code ADEM. It is designed to regulate the peak inductor ripple current, which can be calculated by the formula: 

ICO_RMSÔÅÑIL
12----------=(13)

There is not a relationship between the input capacitor RMS current and voltage conversion ratio.

The power dissipation of the inductor can be approximately calculated by output current and DCR of inductor and output current. The thermal performance of the AOZ2153EQI-30 is strongly affected by the PCB layout. Extra care should be taken by users during design process to ensure that the IC will operate under the recommended environmental conditions. Several layout tips are listed below for the best electric and thermal performance: 

1. The LX pins and pad are connected to internal low side switch drain. They are low resistance thermal conduction path and most noisy switching node. Connected a large copper plane to LX pin to help thermal dissipation.
2. The IN pins""",
